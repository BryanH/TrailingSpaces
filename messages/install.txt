    Thank you for installing Trailing Spaces
    ----------------------------------------

    You're now ready to give trailing spaces *a hard time*!



Documentation
=============

Although the usage of this plugin is dead simple, it comes with several options. All
details are available in the documentation, which you can open by clicking on
"Preferences / Package Settings / Trailing Spaces / Help", or in a prettier form at
https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces.

Key binding
===========

This plugin does not come with a default key binding for the deletion command. You can
pick your own key binding and define it in "Preferences / Key Bindings - User", or just
stick to using the menu "Edit / Delete Trailing Spaces". Check the help for details.

Upgrades, issues
================

Package Control will automatically upgrade all packages every time the editor is started,
so there is nothing for you to worry about. If you however do find the plugin to not work
as it used to, head to the issues tracker (see links below) to report the problem.
